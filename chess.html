<li>Develop your pieces quickly.</li>
<li>Try to control the centre.</li>
<li>Pieces first, pawns second.</li>
<li>Do not move the same piece twice in the opening phase.</li>
<li>Loose pieces drop off.</li>
<li>Maintain a good pawn structure.</li>
<li>When the pieces are equal, the player with the better pawn structure wins.</li>
<li>Every pawn is a potential queen.</li>
<li>Castle early.</li>
<li>Do not get your queen out too early in the opening phase.</li>
<li>Rooks belong on open files.</li>
<li>A knight in the rim is dim (grim).</li>
<li>A bishop pair is better than a knight pair or a knight and a bishop.</li>
<li>A Knight is valuable in the middle game where there are closed positions.</li>
<li>A Bishop is valuable in the end game where there are open positions.</li>
<li>Do not exchange your bishop for a knight without purpose.</li>
<li>Centalise your king in the end game.</li>
<li>Winning is a matter of time.</li>
