<h2><a name="datascience">
What is data science?</a></h2>
Data science is a collection of techniques used to extract value from data.
<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="classes">
What are the different classes of data science problems?</a></h2>
There are two major classes of data science problems.
1. supervised learning model
2. unsupervised learning model
<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="supervised">
What is a supervised learning model?</a></h2>
This model gives training to the machine for solving problems.
<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="unsupervised">
What is an unsupervised learning model?</a></h2>
This model does not give training to the machine for solving problems.
<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="deep">
What is deep learning?</a></h2>
It is a machine learning model based on artificial neural networks, which are inspired by
the functioning of human brain.
 <p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="exploration">
What is data exploration?</a></h2>
Data exploration is the detailed analysis of data to gain better understanding of it.
It can be classified into 2 types.
1. Descriptive Statistics
2. Data Visualisation
<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="descriptive">
What is meant by descriptive statistics?</a></h2>
It is the process of summarising the data using various statistical measures such as mean,
median, mode etc.
<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="visualisation">
What is data visualisation?</a></h2>
It is the process of making visual representation of data using various charts like histogram,
scatter plot, bubble chart etc.
<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="learning">
When can we say that a machine has the ability to learn?</a></h2>
A machine is able to learn if it is able to utilise an experience so that its performance
improves on similar experiences in future.
<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="types">
What are the types of machine learning algorithms?</a></h2>
Machine learning algorithms can be classified into 3 types.
1. Predictive Model
2. Descriptive Model
3. Meta learning Model
