<h2><a name="datascience">
What is data science?</a></h2>
Data science is a collection of techniques used to extract value from data.
<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="classes">
What are the different classes of data science problems?</a></h2>
There are two major classes of data science problems.
1. supervised learning model
2. unsupervised learning model
<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="supervised">
What is a supervised learning model?</a></h2>
This model gives training to the machine for solving problems.
<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="unsupervised">
What is an unsupervised learning model?</a></h2>
This model does not give training to the machine for solving problems.
<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="deep">
What is deep learning?</a></h2>
It is a machine learning model based on artificial neural networks, which are inspired by
the functioning of human brain.
 <p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="exploration">
What is data exploration?</a></h2>
Data exploration is the detailed analysis of data to gain better understanding of it.
It can be classified into 2 types.
1. Descriptive Statistics
2. Data Visualisation
<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="descriptive">
What is meant by descriptive statistics?</a></h2>
It is the process of summarising the data using various statistical measures such as mean,
median, mode etc.
<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="visualisation">
What is data visualisation?</a></h2>
It is the process of making visual representation of data using various charts like histogram,
scatter plot, bubble chart etc.
<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="learning">
When can we say that a machine has the ability to learn?</a></h2>
A machine is able to learn if it is able to utilise an experience so that its performance
improves on similar experiences in future.
<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="types">
What are the types of machine learning algorithms?</a></h2>
Machine learning algorithms can be classified into 3 types.
1. Predictive Model
2. Descriptive Model
3. Meta learning Model
<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="predictive">
What is predictive model?</a></h2>
In this model, we predict the value of a target variable based on a set of input variables
Example - Predicting whether a football team will win or lose
<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="descriptivemodel">
What is descriptive model?</a></h2>
In this model, we identify useful patterns / associations within data.
Example - Identify the items which are bought together from a shop
<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="metalearning">
What is meta learning model?</a></h2>
This model deals with learning how to learn more effectively. This can be used for
improving the performance of machine learning algorithms.
<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="lazy">
What is a lazy learning approach?</a></h2>
This is a learning approach in which classification is done only after preparing the test
data.This approach spends less time on training, and more time on predicting.
<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="probabilistic">
What is probabilistic learning?</a></h2>
In probabilistic learning, the probabilities associated with various events are used for
learning and prediction.
<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="decisiontree">
What is decision tree learning?</a></h2>
It is a machine learning technique used for classification and prediction. This uses a flow
chart like tree structure called decision tree.
<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="classification">
What is classification rules learning?</a></h2>
Classification Rules Learning is a machine learning approach based on classification
rules.A classification rule represent knowledge in the form of logical if..else statements.This
knowledge can be used for classification and prediction.
<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="regression">
What is Regression?</a></h2>
Regression is a statistical technique used for estimating relationships between numerical
data.
<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="simple">
What is simple linear regression?</a></h2>
Simple Linear Regression finds out the linear relationship between single numeric depen-
dent variable and a single numeric independent variable.
<p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="multiple">
What is multiple linear regression?</a></h2>
Multiple Linear Regression finds out the linear relationship between single numeric
dependent variable and multiple numeric independent variables.
